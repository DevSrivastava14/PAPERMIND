# Project Progress & Tracking

## Project Goal
Build a multimodal scientific research paper assistant that answers questions about research PDFs using grounded evidence and citations, with eventual support for text, figures, and tables.

## 33-Day Planned Roadmap

- **Days 1–7: Fundamentals and Text RAG**
  - Architecture, project structure, PDF parsing, text extraction, chunking, embeddings, vector indexing, retrieval pipeline, and baseline question-answering with citations.
- **Days 8–14: Multimodal Extraction**
  - Extracting images, figures, and tables; visual encoding/multimodal embeddings; table parsing; multimodal document representation.
- **Days 15–17: Hybrid Retrieval and Reranking**
  - Sparse (BM25/keyword) + dense retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion (RRF), cross-encoder reranking.
- **Days 18–22: Evaluation and Ragas**
  - Ground truth dataset construction, retrieval and generation metrics (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision/recall) with Ragas, automated evaluation harness.
- **Days 23–28: Security, Guardrails, Langfuse, and Performance**
  - Prompt injection defense, guardrails, observability and tracing with Langfuse, caching, latency and throughput optimization.
- **Days 29–33: Testing, Docker, Documentation, and Interview Preparation**
  - End-to-end integration tests, Docker containerization, comprehensive documentation, portfolio and interview preparation.

## Current State

- **Status:** Day 2 Complete
- **Date:** October 11, 2026
- **Environment:** Windows, Python 3.13.5, active `.venv`
- **Version Control:** Git initialized locally; no commits made (files uncommitted/staged as requested)
- **Configuration & Dependencies:**
  - `requirements.txt`: Pinned to `pymupdf==1.28.2` and `pytest==9.1.1`
  - `.gitignore`: Configured and verified (ignores `.venv/`, pytest/Python caches, `data/*.pdf`, `data/processed/`, `data/uploads/`, `.env*` except `.env.example`, and logs)
  - `.env.example`: Contains `APP_ENV=development`
  - `README.md`: Intentionally kept empty until project completion (ComputeGrid workflow)

## Daily Log

### Day 1 — October 10, 2026 (Completed)
- **Completed Tasks:**
  - Initialized project tracking document (`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`) as the single source of truth.
  - Initialized local Git repository.
  - Verified local environment with Python 3.13.5 and `.venv`.
  - Pinned `requirements.txt` to `pymupdf==1.28.2` and `pytest==9.1.1`.
  - Added and verified `.gitignore` for environment, cache, local data, and log files.
  - Created `.env.example` with `APP_ENV=development`.
  - Implemented initial PDF parser in `app/ingestion/pdf_parser.py` with `extract_pdf_pages(pdf_path)` returning 1-based `page_number`, `text`, and boolean `has_text` (true only if non-whitespace characters exist). Includes error handling for missing files (`FileNotFoundError`), invalid/unreadable PDFs (`ValueError`), and ensures safe document closure.
  - Created test suite in `tests/test_pdf_parser.py` covering multi-page extraction, 1-based page numbering, empty/whitespace pages, missing files, and invalid PDFs with programmatically generated PDFs.
  - Executed tests: `python -m pytest -q` passed (5 passed).
  - Validated parser against `data/sample_paper.pdf`: 7 pages parsed, all 7 contain extractable text. Observed running headers/layout artifacts and line-wrapped references; accepted as baseline extraction limitations without adding ad-hoc cleanup.
- **Changed Files:**
  - `app/ingestion/pdf_parser.py` (Created)
  - `tests/test_pdf_parser.py` (Created)
  - `requirements.txt` (Updated with pinned versions)
  - `.gitignore` (Updated)
  - `.env.example` (Verified)
  - `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` (Updated)
- **Commands & Actual Test Results:**
  - `python -m pytest -q`: 5 passed in 0.25s
  - `git status --short`: untracked files reported, 0 commits made
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Preserved raw PyMuPDF extraction output without heuristic cleaning to keep baseline parser modular and predictable.
  - Kept `README.md` empty until project completion per ComputeGrid workflow.
- **Blockers:**
  - None.

### Day 2 — October 11, 2026 (Completed)
- **Completed Tasks:**
  - Created lightweight standard-library dataclasses in `app/ingestion/models.py`: `PageContent` (`page_number`, `text`, `has_text`) and `ResearchPaperDocument` (`filename`, `total_pages`, `pages`).
  - Added public ingestion interface `parse_research_paper(pdf_path)` in `app/ingestion/pdf_parser.py` reusing existing `extract_pdf_pages()` to avoid logic duplication.
  - Preserved source filename (via `Path(pdf_path).name`), total page count calculation, and wrapped page dictionaries into `PageContent` objects.
  - Maintained 100% backward compatibility for `extract_pdf_pages()` and preserved standard error handling (`FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`).
  - Added 4 new tests in `tests/test_pdf_parser.py` covering document structure, metadata, blank page preservation, error raising, and a fixture-safe smoke test against `data/sample_paper.pdf`.
  - Executed test suite in `.venv`: `.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` passed (9 passed).
- **Changed Files:**
  - `app/ingestion/models.py` (Created)
  - `app/ingestion/pdf_parser.py` (Modified)
  - `tests/test_pdf_parser.py` (Modified)
  - `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` (Updated)
- **Commands & Actual Test Results:**
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q`: 9 passed in 0.52s
  - `git status --short`: `M app/ingestion/pdf_parser.py`, `M tests/test_pdf_parser.py`, `?? app/ingestion/models.py`
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Implemented standard-library dataclasses to avoid unnecessary external dependencies or framework overhead while ensuring type safety and clean interfaces.
  - Kept raw text extraction unchanged to preserve baseline parser modularity.
  - Isolated file basename in `filename` attribute for cleaner downstream citation references.
- **Remaining Limitations:**
  - PDF layout artifacts (headers, footers, hyphenation) remain in raw page text.
  - Extraction remains text-only; figures and tables will be handled in multimodal milestone (Days 8–14).
- **Blockers:**
  - None.

## Handoff

- **Status:** Day 2 is complete.
- **Next Session Instructions (Day 3):**
  1. Read this progress file (`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`).
  2. Implement text chunking strategy tailored for scientific research papers (chunk size, overlap).
  3. Ensure chunk metadata tracks source filename, 1-based page numbers, and chunk index for provenance and citations.
  4. Prepare chunked output structures for downstream embedding and retrieval indexing.
